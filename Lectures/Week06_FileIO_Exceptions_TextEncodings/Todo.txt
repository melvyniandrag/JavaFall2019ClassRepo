1. I suppose you know that numbers are represented in a certain  format on computers. You know, for example, that Java represented whole numbers in one of the following datatypes:
* byte - one byte
* short - two bytes
* int - four bytes
* long - 8 bytes

And we talked last week about the format Java uses. It is abbreviated T.C. 

Ask class what the format is?

And remind everyone the way it works.

1. If number is positive, write normally in all but the top byte. If number is negative:
a) write positive binary
b) flip bits
c) add binary one.
d) now you have the negative binary representation

Well text data is represented in different ways. Twos complement is for integer types, but there are different ways to store text data.

Internally, Java uses the UTF16 format, but this doesn't matter too much to us.

When reading data from a file, Java needs to know the data format of the file.

When writing data to a file, a good programmer ( like you ) ought to specify exactly which data format he/she wants.

Data formats for text data are called "Text Encodings"

The text encodings we will look at today are ASCII, UTF8, and UTF16. 

Use xxd to show the hex contents of files. Unfortunately there is no standard hex viewer in windows.

A text file is a file that just contains text data. 

There are several ways to represent text data that you need to know about.

Today we will talk about ASCII, UTF8 and UTF16.
